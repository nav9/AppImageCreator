# AppImageCreator
A simple Python application that makes it simple to create an AppImage on Linux. The application is not in a polished form (for example, if you try browsing for a Flutter executable, it won't be shown, and you have to manually type the executable name). However, the application did work successfully to build a working AppImage for me. Feel free to extend this program and make it more robust.  
The GUI can definitely be made a lot more intuitive and clean, but that's not a priority for me right now.
